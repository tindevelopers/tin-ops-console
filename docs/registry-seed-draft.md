# Registry seed: draft for review

Drawn from `shell-base-github-registry` (`hubs.json`, `GRAPH.json`, `REGISTER.md`), `tin-boss-api` (`cells/`, `docs/BOSS-API-PROGRAM.md` in `shell-base-admin`) and `konnect-caas-base` (`apps/`, `apps/ops/package.json`). The SQL is `db/seed/001_projects.draft.sql`. **Not applied to Neon.** Owners are left empty because no repo records them.

Also seeded: 3 environments (`tin-boss-api` development with cell `konnect-dev`; `konnect-ops` development; `tin-ops-console` production), 20 declared versions, one BOSS mode and 20 relationships.

## Declared versions
- **`konnect-ops`, development:** 17 `@tindevelopers/*` versions copied from `apps/ops/package.json` on `main`, such as `ui-shell 1.2.0`, `core-kernel 3.0.0`, `adapter-kit 1.9.1`, `knowledge 0.4.1`. These are what the code requires, not a verified deployment. Several already differ from the registry's `latest`, so they will show as drift straight away.
- **`tin-ops-console`, production:** `ui-shell 1.2.0`, `domain-identity 2.3.0`, `schema-identity 1.1.0`.

## Assumptions to confirm
1. **`shell-base-admin` as `shell-base`.** I used that kind for it only; the other `shell-base-*` repos are hubs, as the registry calls them. Say if "Shell Base" should mean something wider.
2. **Packages are not projects.** There are 39 and the collector already observes each one, so they appear as declared versions instead. The `package` kind is unused for now.
3. **`konnect-ops` BOSS mode is `inprocess`.** Stage 4 adoption is still "planned", so in-process is the safe default.
4. **Cell name `konnect-dev`** is the cell file's name; the BOSS cell's own `name` is `tin-boss-api-konnect-dev`. The first collector run will show which one it reports.
5. **Relationships for `konnect-ops` are inferred** from its dependencies (for example `knowledge` implies `shell-base-knowledge`); `tin-boss-api` consuming `shared-api-hub` is inferred from its `API_CREDENTIALS_*` settings. The other seven Konnect apps have no declared versions yet; their `package.json` files were not read.
6. **Not included:** `shell-base-release-kit`, and the many other repos in the account (client sites, forks, older platforms), because I found no link to this platform.
